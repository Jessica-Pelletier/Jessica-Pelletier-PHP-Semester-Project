#WanderWise Travel Itinerary Maker

##Introduction
WanderWise is a travel itinerary generator. The program requires user registration and login. For the MVP of this program, users will be able to pick from one of a few locations and the program will generate an itinerary for the length of the trip based on available time/day and how much time each activity requires. 

#Current Status 
At this time, the program is not running. The database is nearly connect for user registration. Once complete, the logic flow for the itinerary generator will be worked on. I will update this as required. 

##TroubleShooting
All configuration and databse info is in config.php and database.php.

In order to add more pages to the index of the site, Add a controller file for intended page 'page.php' as well as a view for the page 'page.view.php' and reference the view page in the controller file via a require file.
