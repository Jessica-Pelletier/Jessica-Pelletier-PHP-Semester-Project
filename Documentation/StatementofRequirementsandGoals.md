<h1>Statement of Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Connect New Itinerary Creation Form to DB</h2>
            <p>I need to connect the form on newitin.php to my database. I almost accomplished it but had issues with retrieving enum values from DB. The textbook starts to go over retreiving data on page 444.
            </p>

    <li>
        <h2>Implement Password Matching
        </h2>
        <p>A few people in the class suggested implementing password matching. It was something I initially tried to do but felt it took too long to trouble shoot once I ran into error. It should be completed as it's an important part of user registration.
    </li>
    <li> 
        <h2>Personalizing the navigation Bar</h2>
        <p>My navigation bar currently has the greeting "Hello Jessica!" but it is static.  I'd like to make it dynamic and have it pull the users name. On page 622 of the textbook it goes over personalizing the navigation bar. In the least, I would like the navigation to be dynamic. It time is available for styling purposes; I'd like to move the greeting up into the header as advised in class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>The Itinerary<h2> 
        <p>I'd like to be realistic about my itinerary planner. Although it is the primary function of the application, I don't know to what level it is realistic for me to expect to complete. I'm trying to think of ways that I can render it down to its most simple form. Perhaps when the user inputs the location, the generation will select a pre made itinerary. Just for the purposes of acheiving something in DGL123. Jeffrey Way talks about getting items from the DB and showing them in list form in Video 16. </p>
    </li>    
    <li>
        <h2>Other class suggestions</h2>
        <p>Alot of the class suggestions were to do with interface and design. But some of the comments are vague. "I wish the list was a little more well-designed" & "Improve the user interface design". Adding some styling is important to me and i considered adding some cards under my itineraries, that represent each planned trip, to make things a little more visual but at this time in the course. I don't have plenty of time and my application is hardly functioning.</p>
