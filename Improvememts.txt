ChatGPT prompts:
(Home page) what can I do to make this look more professional?

(home)are there any simple features you would add?
Answered provided were ideas that were on the larger side (integrate maps, user registration and profiles etc)

(New itinerary)Given the previous css, what would you suggest i add to this form?
So far this is has given the best, most direct response. It was suggesting that I Style buttons that match other buttons on my webstime. 

I followed up the previous question with "What is it missing that would provide value to the user or that would help me better gather information to make a random generated itinerary".
Some of the better suggestions were :
-Budget Input
-Number of Travelers
-Preferences (I wouldnt add preferences at this point but I do think having some form of this in the opposite way. Having users check things they AREN'T able to do. or having accessibility options. So that the itineray doesn't suggest hiking a mountain to a wheelchair bound person).



I copied my class critiques and asked it to summarize:
<hr>
 Lack of a footer on the pages.
Presence of a second password box that may not be necessary.
Forms don't appear to handle and validate bad inputs.
The layout design needs improvement.
Responsiveness should be worked on to ensure the site looks good on various devices.
Other pages require attention.
Spelling mistake: "intineraries" should be corrected to "itineraries."
Suggestion to make the right-side menu collapsible, especially on smaller screens.
Consider implementing a hamburger menu or pop-out menu for mobile views, which is a conventional approach.
