ChatGPT prompts:
-(Home page) what can I do to make this look more professional?

-(home)are there any simple features you would add?
Answered provided were ideas that were on the larger side (integrate maps, user registration and profiles etc)

-(New itinerary)Given the previous css, what would you suggest i add to this form?
So far this is has given the best, most direct response. It was suggesting that I Style buttons that match other buttons on my website. 

-I followed up the previous question with "What is it missing that would provide value to the user or that would help me better gather information to make a random generated itinerary".

Some of the better suggestions were :
-Budget Input
-Number of Travelers
-Preferences (I wouldnt add preferences at this point but I do think having some form of this in the opposite way. Having users check things they AREN'T able to do. or having accessibility options. So that the itineray doesn't suggest hiking a mountain to a wheelchair bound person).



I copied my class critiques and asked it to summarize (some of which I've fixed in the last week and have removed from the list):

-Presence of a second password box that may not be necessary.
-Forms don't appear to handle and validate bad inputs.
-The layout design needs improvement.
-Responsiveness should be worked on to ensure the site looks good on various devices.
-Spelling mistake: "intineraries" should be corrected to "itineraries."
-Suggestion to make the right-side menu collapsible, especially on smaller screens.
-Consider implementing a hamburger menu or pop-out menu for mobile views, which is a conventional approach.


Areas that Chatgpt and the class have in common: 

Primarily my forms. Catching and reducing errors.

For this class period iteration I will 

-Fix name/title errors in html
-Implement requirments to inputs validation and error messages
-Fix the margins and spacing around my forms 

In the end I was able to do alot on my onboard form. 
I fixed input types. I started with input=text and corrected to input=email, input=password etc.
I implemented a function that I found in the textbook that creates password requirements and displays a message whether password is valid or not. 
My issue now is how to get it to to go the next page. my password is valid but it just gives me a message "password is valid" but doesnt push me to the next page.

UPDATE: 
After getting help from classmates, my form now sends me to the next page when the form details are correct!
